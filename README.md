# üå¶Ô∏è Weather App (React + OpenWeatherMap API)

This is a weather application that utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap REST API** to display the current conditions and a 5-day forecast, with **dynamic video backgrounds** that change based on the weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.). The app uses a **Node.js + Express backend** to securely proxy API requests and protect the API key.
